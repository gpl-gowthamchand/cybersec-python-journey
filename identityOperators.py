# Identity operators

a = 10 
b = 10 

print( a is b )     # is - returns True if both variables are pointing to a same object

print( a is not b)  # is not - returns True if both variables are not pointing to same object 


# I have small confusion with this Idententy operators, if this examples are not correct please let me know or free to modify and contribute..
